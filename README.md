Unity HoloToolkit Research Project augmenting Victoria Statue at DHM

## Abstract
This Unity HoloLens application was developed together with Museum 4.0, Deutsches Historisches Museum (DHM), and Framefield at FU Berlin as a research project. The application aims to explore different levels of initiative in pure mixed reality (PMR) museum guides. It implements three conditions we labled as guided (system initiative), un-guided (user initiative) and co-active (mixed-initiative).
